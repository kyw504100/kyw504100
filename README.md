What are you looking for? <br>
I'm just a ordinary Hong Kong student who preparing for 2022 HKDSE. <br>
Currently studying "ICT" (***I***nformation and ***C***ommunication ***T***echnology) in high school. <br>
Sounds cool right? <br>
But I rather call it "Basic Computing" for its extremely outdated syllabus which has never been updated since ***2009***. <br>
The textbook still teach us how to use Adobe Flash, still telling us 802.11 ***AC*** is the latest ***upcoming*** Wi-Fi standard. <br>
### Ridiculous.
## Languages

Only basic HTML(***4***) and JavaScript are included in the syllabus, so quite limited.<br>
â€‹ <br>
Yup, HTML ***4***. <br>
Do you guys still use the <â€‹FONTâ€‹> tag? <br>
â€‹ <br>
What? How about CSS?
### None.

## Others

Basic SQL and Excel functions, nothing fancy.
