What are you looking for? <br>
I'm just a ordinary Hong Kong student who preparing for 2022 HKDSE. <br>
Currently studying "ICT" (**I**nformation and **C**ommunication **T**echnology). <br>
Sounds cool right? <br>
But I rather call it "Basic Computing" for its extremely outdated syllabus which has never been updated since 2009. <br>

## Languages

Only basic HTML and JavaScript are included in the syllabus, so quite limited.<br>
What? How about CSS?
### None.

## Others

Basic SQL and Excel functions, nothing fancy.
